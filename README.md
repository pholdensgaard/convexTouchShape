# Convex Touch surface project

This is a complete guide to implement touch on a convex shape. The guide utilises unity as a car simulation to try navigation of a vehicle using touch on a convex shape and regular joystick (xbox One Controller using bluetooth) for research purposes. 

### Hardware requirements

- Microchip AVR128DA48 Curiosity Nano Evaluation Kit (https://www.microchip.com/Developmenttools/ProductDetails/DM164151)
- QT8 Xplained Pro Extention Kit (https://www.microchip.com/developmenttools/ProductDetails/AC164161)
- Curiosity Nano Touch Adapter (https://www.microchip.com/developmenttools/ProductDetails/AC80T88A)
- Xbox One Controller

### Required requipment and materials
- Dual extrude 3D printer (Ultimaker S5 in our case)
- Conductive filament (Proto pasta, but other conductive filaments works as well)
- PLA plastic

### Required software (free)
- Microchip Studio
- Unity
- Microsoft Visual Studio

### Provided code in this project
- Microchip Studio project for retriving touch input from the AVR128DA48 
- Complete unity project to run simulation including scrip to retrieve touch input from the touch surface

### 3D models for printing
- Convex shape in a SolidWorks Assembly

## Get started

1. Download Microchip Studio and Connect AVR128DA48 using a data USB-A to USB-Micro-b
